# 100CSSArt-Challenge
this repo will contain my 100 css art

## Why, I made this challenge?
I'm always fascinated how other developer create amazing art by only using HTML and CSS. This what inpired me to create this challenge myself to learn CSS while having fun.

## Goal
- Create css art until it reaches 100
- Create CodePen for testing and showcasing each css art
- Sharing it on twitter
